# Cloud Security Automation
This is the code repository for [Cloud Security Automation](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/cloud-security-automation?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788627863), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Security issues are still a major concern for all IT organizations. For many enterprises, the move to cloud computing has raised concerns for security, but when applications are architected with focus on security, cloud platforms can be made just as secure as on-premises platforms. Cloud instances can be kept secure by employing security automation that helps make your data meet your organization's security policy.

This book starts with the basics of why cloud security is important and how automation can be the most effective way of controlling cloud security. You will then delve deeper into the AWS cloud environment and its security services by dealing with security functions such as Identity and Access Management and will also learn how these services can be automated. Moving forward, you will come across aspects such as cloud storage and data security, automating cloud deployments, and so on. Then, you'll work with OpenStack security modules and learn how private cloud security functions can be automated for better time- and cost-effectiveness. Toward the end of the book, you will gain an understanding of the security compliance requirements for your Cloud.

By the end of this book, you will have hands-on experience of automating your cloud security and governance.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter06.



The code will look like the following:
```
{
    "Sid": "AllowCreationOfServiceLinkedRoles",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}
```

Readers should have a basic understanding of AWS, OpenStack, and CentOS.

An AWS user account is required. If you don't have a user account, ensure that you have your credit card ready in order to open a free account. (While we have taken care to use the free-tier systems in AWS, make sure that you use the appropriate instance sizes and AMI IDs if you are creating an environment in a different region.)
